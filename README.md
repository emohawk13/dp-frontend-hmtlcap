Assignment - HTML Capstone

I chose to replicate the wordpress site: https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/




A great way to practicing coding is to replicate a professional website as closely as you can. This practice helps you see new ways of building and inspires you to find solutions to new challenges.

Replicate a page layout of either a webpage or webpage template.

Replicate one of the following:
Wordpress blog webpage template
A wikipedia page
An ecommerce shop's view of products
A social media site you enjoy
Another frequently visited webpage

Try writing an HTML mockup over the template. Create a series of boxes on a blank whiteboard or paper ot represent each element on the page. Use lines in t he boxes to show where text is and an "X" through the box shows where images go. Write your tags and attributes on the inside of each box.
After developing the mockup, develop your division containers. Find the patterns wihin the template and write your classes accordingly.
Fill in each division container with the correct tags, attributes and elements from your mockup.
Focus on creating the structure of the layout. Use filler or simple information such as the "Lorem Ipsum" phrase.

Explore nested tables. Be sure to pay attention to all tag wrapping and to organize your tag structure.
Include a link to your git repository or repl in the field below.
